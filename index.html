        <p>The Vanishing Armada
            For centuries, the Bermuda Triangle has been a silent predator, swallowing ships and aircraft whole — leaving behind only fragments of stories. The disappearance of the USS Cyclops (1918) remains one of the triangle’s greatest enigmas. This massive navy vessel, carrying over 10,000 tons of manganese ore and 309 crew members, sailed from Barbados — only to vanish without a trace. No distress signals, no wreckage... only silence. The ocean became a graveyard without a body.
            
            Not far behind came the notorious Flight 19 (1945) — five US Navy bombers flying a routine training mission. Radio transmissions reported compasses spinning wildly and the ocean shimmering like liquid glass. As night fell, they faded into the shadows, becoming another unsolved whisper of the Bermuda Triangle. Even the search plane sent to rescue them disappeared — fueling the theory that the triangle isn't just a location... but a portal to something far beyond human comprehension.
            
            The Lost Civilization Beneath the Waves
            Legends breathe life into the waters surrounding the triangle — some say the triangle guards the ruins of Atlantis, an ancient city buried beneath layers of time. Recent sonar scans revealed strange geometric structures resting on the ocean floor — pyramids, symmetrical walls, and mysterious monoliths aligned like forgotten relics.
            
            Scientists argue these are natural formations, but could nature carve such perfect shapes? The locals whisper of bright lights glowing from the seabed, and divers report electrical devices malfunctioning when approaching the ruins — as if something beneath the waves is still alive... watching... waiting.
